      description: >
        Some elven families have such long traditions of producing wizards and other arcane spellcasters
        that they raise their children with the assumption each is destined to be a powerful magic-user, 
        with little need for mundane concerns such as skill with weapons. Elves with this racial trait 
        gain a +2 racial bonus on concentration checks made to cast arcane spells defensively.

      name: Darkvision
      description: >
        Though uncommon, some groups of elves are born with darkvision, rather than low-light vision. 
        In many cases this is taken as a sign of a drow in the elf's ancestry, and can lead to persecution 
        within the elf's home community. Elves with this racial trait gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, 
        but also gain sensitivity to light and are dazzled in areas of bright light or within the radius of a 
        daylight spell.
      effect: 
        effect_text: Darkvision 60ft        
        replaces:
